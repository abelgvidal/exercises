"""
This module contains rules for prices and the object PricingRules.

If you need to add new price functions:
 - add at least one item which this function applies to in the json
   file naming its function with the key "type" and other neccesary 
   attributes like code, name and unit_price. more attributes can also 
   be included if needed
 - define below the funcion with the same name which receives:
   - input: price_info, units
   - output: unit_price
 - add a new element to the PricingRules.rules dictionary
 - et voil√°!
